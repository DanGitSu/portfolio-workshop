Hello! My name is Daniel Su.

I am a student studying a Bachelors of Computer Science Honours at the University of Technology Sydney.

I like Chess, Coffee and Computers.

Currently I looking to explore with more depth into the world of Cybersecurity, I want to lay down
the foundations I need so that when I find something I really enjoy, I can get really good at it.
