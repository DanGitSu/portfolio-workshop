## Why am I Blogging?
 I find that Blogging is the easiest way for me to document and showcase all of the work I am doing
 in one, self managed spot. I also hope that these blogs will help keep me motivated and on track 
 with developing my skills, learning new things and gaining new experiences. The topics of these
 blogs I haven't fully decided but for now I hope to post about my dive into Cybersecurity and also
 about any other computing related projects I may decide to undertake.

## How often will I Blog?
 On the minimum I hope to blog at least once a week. There may be circumstances where I do one big 
 blog post or a few connected blogs (_these will be made easy to follow by the links I will put in
 the blogs_)

## Who are these Blogs for?
 These blogs are aimed at those who want to know a bit more about me, but also to help others who
 are on a similar journey through computing by writing down all my experiences in an easy to
 digest way, sort of like a public diary. The questions I hope I can answer for them are: 
 - What are Daniel's Interests?
 - How does Daniel spend his time?
 - How was Daniel's experience with ---> _insert some topic or event_
